# Q Feedback

1. Q is slow.
2. If Q is open you cannot do anything else in intellij. You have to close the Q tab.
3. Q Tab is unstable saw several Crashes. Had to disable and re-enable to get it to start again.
    - Emphasis on lots of crashes. Sometimes I have had to restart intellij entirely
4. Q Chat history is easily lost in a crash or on intellij restart.
5. Q Text entry gets reformatted --- resulting in bad questions being sent to Q
6. No way to copy a response from Q
7. CodeWhisperer suggestions can get in the way of intellisense suggestions
8. Q responses are underwhelming. Example:

#### Request:

```
I just ran the command `java --version` and got the following output:

Unrecognized option: --version
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.

How do I find what version of java is running on this server
```

#### Response:

```
Based on the error message you shared, it looks like Java is not installed or properly configured on the server you ran that command on. A few things you could try:

Check if Java is actually installed by looking for a 'java' or 'javac' executable on the system path. You can try running `which java` or `whereis java` depending on your operating system. [1]
If Java is installed, double check the system PATH variable includes the directory with the Java binaries. On Linux/Mac it would typically be /usr/bin/java.
Check the server setup documentation or ask the system administrators to verify what version of Java, if any, is supported on that environment.
As a last resort, if you have access, try installing a new version of Java explicitly using package managers or by downloading/extracting the JDK directly.
Let me know if any of those suggestions help uncover the Java version or if you have any other questions! Properly setting up the Java environment is important.

Interestingly the links actually have the correct answer, that the correct way to get the java version is to use a single `-` not two:
```
java â€“version
```

This indicates that it doesn't really use the information it links to.

By comparison here is how the OpenAI's Free ChatGPT (3.5) responded (This is not even the paid tier):

#### Response:

The error you're encountering suggests that the `--version` option is not recognized by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) you are using. To check the version of Java on your server, you can use the following command without the `--version` option:


java -version


This command will display information about the version of Java installed on your system. If you're still having issues, it's possible that the `java` command is not in your system's PATH, or there may be an issue with your Java installation.

Additionally, if you have multiple versions of Java installed, you might want to specify the full path to the Java executable. For example:


/path/to/java/bin/java -version


Replace "/path/to/java" with the actual path where your Java executable is located.

If you're still facing issues or if you have specific requirements for Java version management, consider checking your system's documentation or seeking help from your system administrator.

One downside is that there were not sources linked to this response.

9. I have had Q suggest to me that I use features of the aws sdk for java v2 which do not exist. I provided links to release notes that did not work and it provided plausible use cases.
10. The new codewhisper connection workflow crashed and cleared my aws cli config.
